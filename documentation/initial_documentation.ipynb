    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's world, understanding human emotions plays a crucial role in various domains such as psychology, marketing, and human-computer interaction. Emotions significantly impact human decision-making, behavior, and interactions. As technology advances, there is a growing interest in developing systems that can automatically recognize and interpret human emotions. This project focuses on crowd emotion recognition, which involves detecting and classifying the emotions of individuals in a crowd from images and videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Crowd Emotion Recognition project aims to develop a system that can automatically classify the emotions present within a crowd image or video. The system leverages deep learning techniques and utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model to accurately detect and classify emotions. The project integrates a web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload or capture images and videos, which are then processed to detect emotions. Various visualizations are provided to help users understand the distribution and performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is designed to handle grayscale images from the FER2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 facial images categorized into seven emotion classes: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip are applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotion recognition is a complex task due to the subtle and varying expressions of human emotions. Recognizing emotions in a crowd adds another layer of complexity, as it involves detecting multiple faces with different expressions in a single image or video frame. Traditional methods often struggle with accuracy and efficiency, particularly in real-time applications. The challenge is to develop a robust system that can accurately detect and classify emotions in a crowd setting, providing real-time feedback and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objectives of the Crowd Emotion Recognition project are:\n",
    "1. To develop a machine learning model capable of accurately recognizing and classifying emotions in images and videos.\n",
    "2. To create a user-friendly web application that allows users to upload or capture media for emotion detection.\n",
    "3. To implement data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance and generalization.\n",
    "4. To provide various data visualizations to help users understand the distribution of emotions and the model's performance.\n",
    "5. To evaluate the system's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5 Study Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Crowd Emotion Recognition project aims to achieve accurate and efficient emotion detection, there are several limitations to consider:\n",
    "1. **Dataset Limitation**: The system is trained on the FER2013 dataset, which may not encompass the full range of human emotions and expressions. This can limit the model's ability to generalize to real-world scenarios with diverse and complex emotions.\n",
    "2. **Model Limitations**: The ResNet50 model, while powerful, may not capture all the nuances of facial expressions, leading to potential misclassifications.\n",
    "3. **Real-time Processing**: Although the system aims to provide real-time emotion detection, processing multiple faces in high-resolution videos can be computationally intensive and may result in latency.\n",
    "4. **Environmental Factors**: Variations in lighting, occlusions, and background noise in images and videos can affect the accuracy of emotion detection.\n",
    "5. **Ethical Considerations**: The deployment of emotion recognition systems raises ethical concerns regarding privacy and consent, which must be carefully addressed in practical applications.\n",
